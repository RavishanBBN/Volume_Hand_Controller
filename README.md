# Volume_Hand_Controller
A Python-based project that allows users to control the volume of their device using hand gestures. Utilizing computer vision and machine learning libraries such as OpenCV and MediaPipe, the program detects hand movements through the camera, translating them into volume adjustments for a seamless, touchless experience.
